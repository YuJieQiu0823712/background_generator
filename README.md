# background_generator

In this practice, I install `npm`(globally) (to generate `package.json`), `node`(download file), `lodash`(locally), `live-server`(globally), and use `browserify`(globally) to require `lodash` by writing `script.js` to `bundle.js`.

1. clone this repository
    `git clone https://github.com/YuJieQiu0823712/background_generator.git`

2. Install node_modules
    `npm install`

3. Remove the remote repository named origin from your Git configuration.
    `git remote remove origin`

4. To see the demo
    `live-server`

5. After each update of script.js, execute the following command
    `npm run build`
